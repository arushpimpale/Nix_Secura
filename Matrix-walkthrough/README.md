## Introduction

The *Matrix1* challenge is a practical exercise designed to enhance penetration testing skills. It involves:
1. Network discovery.
2. Service enumeration.
3. Password cracking and brute-forcing.
4. Retrieving the final flag.

This guide provides detailed steps to help users navigate through the challenge.

## Tools Used

- *Netdiscover*: Scans and discovers live hosts on a network using ARP requests.
- *Nmap*: Maps networks, scans for open ports, and identifies vulnerabilities.
- *Crunch*: Generates custom wordlists for password cracking.
- *Hydra*: Performs brute-force attacks on various protocols and services.
- *SSH (Secure Shell)*: Securely connects to remote systems.
- *Vi/Vim*: A powerful terminal-based text editor.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Network Discovery
Use *Netdiscover* to identify live hosts within the network. It sends ARP requests and collects responses to identify devices.

### Step 2: Port Scanning
Run *Nmap* with the -p- option to scan all ports on the target IP address. Identify open ports and active services.

### Step 3: Accessing Services
1. Identify port 80 (HTTP).
2. Visit the target's IP address in Firefox.

### Step 4: Analyzing Web Pages
1. Inspect the page source code using "Inspect Element."
2. Extract the relevant information.

### Step 5: Decode Hidden Information
1. Use the echo command to manipulate and display text.
2. Navigate to [decode.fr](https://www.decode.fr/brainfuck-language) to decode the extracted text and retrieve the password.

### Step 6: Wordlist Generation
Use *Crunch* to generate a wordlist tailored for brute-forcing login credentials.

### Step 7: Brute-Force Login
Use *Hydra* to perform brute-force attacks on services like SSH and obtain valid credentials.

### Step 8: Access via SSH
Log in to the target system using SSH and the discovered credentials.

### Step 9: File Editing with Vi/Vim
Utilize Vi/Vim for:
- Editing configuration files.
- Executing shell commands directly within the editor.

### Step 10: Retrieve the Flag
1. Export the shell and path variables.
2. Navigate to the /root directory.
3. Retrieve the flag.

## Features

- *Comprehensive Reconnaissance*: Tools for discovering hosts and services.
- *Advanced Exploitation*: Decoding, brute-forcing, and accessing secure systems.
- *Custom Wordlist Generation*: Tailored password cracking.
- *Practical Learning*: Hands-on exposure to penetration testing techniques.
