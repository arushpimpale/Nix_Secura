## Introduction

The *CTF1* challenge is designed to test and enhance your penetration testing skills. It involves:
1. Network reconnaissance.
2. Vulnerability identification.
3. Exploitation of services.
4. Gathering key information for challenge completion.

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to solving the challenge while using industry-standard tools.

## Tools Used

- *Nmap*: For network scanning and vulnerability assessment.
- *Netdiscover*: For identifying live hosts on the network.
- *Nikto*: For scanning web servers for vulnerabilities.
- *Gobuster*: For brute-forcing directories and files.
- *Hydra*: For password cracking and brute-forcing login credentials.
- *SSH (Secure Shell)*: For securely accessing remote servers.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Network Scanning with Nmap
Run *Nmap* to discover live hosts, open ports, and services. Analyze the results to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Step 2: Host Discovery with Netdiscover
Use *Netdiscover* to map out the network and find live hosts.

### Step 3: Web Server Scanning with Nikto
Scan the target's web server using *Nikto* to identify vulnerabilities and configurations.

### Step 4: Analyze robots.txt
1. Open the target in Firefox.
2. Check the robots.txt file for sensitive information.
3. Copy the text for further analysis.

### Step 5: Directory Brute-Forcing with Gobuster
Run *Gobuster* to find hidden directories or files on the web server. For example, locate sudo.html.

### Step 6: Source Code Analysis
1. Open the identified HTML file in a browser.
2. Inspect the page source to find sensitive information (e.g., credentials or usernames).

### Step 7: Brute-Force Login with Hydra
Use *Hydra* to perform a brute-force attack on login credentials.

### Step 8: Secure Access via SSH
Log in to the target system using the discovered credentials with *SSH*.

## Features

- *Network Reconnaissance*: Tools for discovering hosts and mapping services.
- *Web Vulnerability Scanning*: Identify misconfigurations and security flaws in web servers.
- *Brute-Forcing Capabilities*: Access restricted areas using powerful tools.
- *Hands-On Learning*: Practical exposure to penetration testing techniques.
